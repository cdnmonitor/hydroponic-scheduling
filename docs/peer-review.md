# Evaluating the peer review feedback
We recieved feedback from our peers working on HTTPly, and the most valuable feedback we've been given is the Arduino Farm API and its functionality. When testing, we noticed a discrepency between the server and the mock server. The Arduino Farm API was not working as intended, as the request handling on the Arduino was not built to handle bad requests. The feedback we were given was helpful to figure out how to catch more bad requests, but it gave path to a function for making requests and its error handling and polling, guaranteeing every request will come through even if it fails on the first attempt. I knew this day would come when the mock server and the interpretation server were working flawlessly but my home server had issues. Now that I have a better approach for the Arduino Farm API, I will implement the full functionality of the farm and its API and use the new Arduino API for the utility.
